A simple watch wristband, should work well with pretty much any flexible filament.

Default size of one link is 4mm - should be trivial to adjust, but currently there's a hack on one side of the links which may blow up for different link sizes.

For building your own stuff you can use the individual modules:

- half_link is half a link
- link is a full link, composed of two half links
- watch_link connects to the watch via standard watch lugs

Typically you'd probably just call =wristband()=, which takes the arguments links, height and optional rod_thickness.

Measure your wrist, subtract length of the watch, divide the measured mm by 4, and use that as number of links - take into account that there are 2 additional links for the mounting on top of that.

Measure the space available for the wristband, and set that as height.

If you have very thin or thick lugs adjust the rod_thickness parameter, which defaults to 1.6.
